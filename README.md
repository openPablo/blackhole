## Inspiration

I was inspired by this super interesting youtube video, in which the OP created a blackhole simulation using C++ and openGL.

- No runge-kutta method
- 2d geodesic instead of 3d
- use WebGL instead of openGL
- put all raytracing code in the fragment shader
- raytrace from the camera PoV instead of the back
