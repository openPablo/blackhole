## Inspiration

I was inspired by this super interesting youtube video, in which the OP created a blackhole simulation using C++ and openGL.

So I decided to give it a go and try to implement a blackhole efficient enough, that it could be ran in the browser.

I learned Threejs/webGL through this exercise :).
